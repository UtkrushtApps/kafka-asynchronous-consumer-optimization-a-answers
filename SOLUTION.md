# Solution Steps

1. Create a KafkaConsumerConfig class to configure consumer settings: enable manual offset commit, tune poll/fetch/session and concurrency properties, and set factory ack mode to MANUAL_IMMEDIATE.

2. Implement an AsyncKafkaAnalyticsConsumer Spring component. Use @KafkaListener with batch mode. Wire a bounded ThreadPoolExecutor for async batch processing and backpressure.

3. On receiving a Kafka batch (List<ConsumerRecord>), submit batch processing as a CompletableFuture on the thread pool. Track inflight batches using a latch and completion callback.

4. After batch processing succeeds, immediately commit (ack) offsets manually. On failure, retry batch processing for a configured number of attempts, using exponential or fixed backoff.

5. If all retries fail, log and optionally route bad events to a DLQ; always commit offset to avoid lag growth (otherwise the consumer will stall on poison pills).

6. Gracefully shutdown the async thread pool with @PreDestroy for application shutdown.

7. Implement an AnalyticsEventProcessor service to handle the business logic (in this sample, delegate to a repository for batch DB writes, no string concatenation in a tight loop).

8. Abstract the persistence layer as AnalyticsEventRepository. Implementation is assumed done elsewhere per spec.

9. Optimize code for bulk operations and minimal object allocations (stream and toList for mapping records, avoid string concatenation in processor).

10. Wire all beans in the Spring context, parameterize properties, and set containerFactory property on the @KafkaListener.
